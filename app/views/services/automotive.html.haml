                We completely take over the part of the manufacturing process and responsibility.
                We dismantle the received and assemble parts or we dismantle the received and pack them with other parts and send them to other assembly plants to be re-assembled.
                You donâ€™t need to keep track of how many people are needed or deal with all the hassles that come with it. You just tell us how many and when.
