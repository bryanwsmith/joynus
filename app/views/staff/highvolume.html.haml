                When large number of people are working in a same place, keeping track of who clocked in/out can be payroll 
                and invoice nightmare. Joynus covers all loop holes for attendance. Pin or bio attendance machine synced with
                mobile and web application makes attendance efficient, but even further, seamless integration with payroll and
                billing mitigates error. Plus we have someone physically at the site.

                It’s not only a safety training but it’s training with safety in mind. <br>First every one of Joynus associates
                must know how and what to do on the job. Even further, we explain why. <br>Second, through our On Site Program, 
                we follow up on their job training and measure performance.
