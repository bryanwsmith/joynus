          %b> Temp -
          These are positions ranging from one afternoon, to full time work for up to a year. The important thing to know is that there is no promise of the position turning into a permanent position with benefits
        %p
          %b Temp to hire -
          %a{:href => "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permatemp"}
          Temp-to-hire is a working arrangement in which a worker is hired first on a temporary basis – usually through a temporary staffing agency – with the possibility of the position becoming full-time
        %p
          %b Short term -
          short-term employment are workers who hold explicit or implicit contracts of employment which are expected to last longer than the period used to define casual workers, but shorter than the one
          used to define regular employees. These workers may be classified as employees or own- account workers according to the specific characteristics of the employment contract
