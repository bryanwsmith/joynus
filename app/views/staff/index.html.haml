      %h2.text-center.secondary-text What are Temp, Temp to hire &amp; Short term?
      %p
        %b Temp -
        Temporary employment is an ideal solution for unpredictable workloads, project work, seasonal peaks, and other limited-term needs, such as a leave of absence. Temp positions typically have a set timeframe. Through all assignments, the talent is employed by the staffing firm
      %p
        %b Temp to hire -
        Temp-to-hire is a working arrangement in which a worker is hired first on a temporary basis – usually through a temporary staffing agency – with the possibility of the position becoming full-time
      %p
        %b Short term -
        short-term employment are workers who hold explicit or implicit contracts of employment which are expected to last longer than the period used to define casual workers, but shorter than the one
        used to define regular employees. These workers may be classified as employees or own- account workers according to the specific characteristics of the employment contract
