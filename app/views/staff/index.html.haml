              RETENTION
          %p
            It’s inefficient to have turnover. It hurts especially when the well trained, well performing individual leaves. 
            Retention is our #1 strength. Our expertise in retention is why many clients hire us. 
            We don’t have a perfect strategy for retention. Instead, we have perfect strategies.
