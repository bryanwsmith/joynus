                GOAL CRUSHING ATTITUDE
                
            %p Having a passion and pride for always doing what we say we are going to do. Saying the goal out loud.

                COMMUNICATION
            %p Communication is not about writing a long email. It’s about delivering the conceptual idea as vivid as an image and making sure all parties are on the same page.

                COMMITMENT
                  
            %p Jedi master Yoda once said “Do or Do not. There is no try.” This is a statement of commitment. We do not just try, we do not merely plan, we do not only hope; we actually do it.

                NO EXCUSE ATTITUDE
            %p Things don't always go as planned and it is tempting to blame.  Blaming is not taking control. Take control by looking for what we could have done differently. Fix the problem and learn from mistakes.

                OPENNESS & HONESTY
             
            %p Openness and honesty helps finding solutions that lead to improvement.  Joynus develops open and honest relationships where we feel comfortable sharing achievements as well as disappointment.
